# Contributing to the Fabrik project

As an open source project, we encourage and value contributions by our users,
be they additions to the wiki or bug-fixes / enhancements to our code. Since
we provide our software free, if you feel that you have benefited from it,
please consider giving something back to the fabrik community by contributing
your time, skills and fabrik knowledge.

The Fabrikar staff are currently working hard on delivering the next major version of Fabrik
needed to keep pace with the next major version of Joomla.
They are also providing forum support to you and other users and fixing bugs as they are identified.
Unfortunately, With limited resources there will always be a lot of minor bugs, minor enhancements
and documentation opportunities which they don't have time to get to,
and any help that the community can give with these will always be welcome.

**So if you have the time and the inclination, any help you can give with
fixing bugs, writing enhancements, editing / creating wiki pages,
translating fabrik strings from english to other languages or
by helping other, less experienced users by answering forum posts
will always be welcomed.**

## Code contributions

A list of minor bugs and minor enhancements is maintained in our Wiki's
[Code Contributions Wishlist page](http://fabrikar.com/forums/index.php?wiki/code-contributions-wishlist/).
If you identify a minor bug or feature you would like to see, please add it there,
or alternatively note that you are going to try to develop the code to address items.

## Wiki contributions

The Wiki pages themselves are always in need of TLC to keep the examples current,
to add new information or examples that will help other users avoid the pitfalls that you
encountered. There are also stub pages (marked with "(+)") which need to be written.

## Forum contributions

If you see a new question on the [community forums](http://fabrikar.com/forums/index.php?forums/community.99/)
then please feel free to chip in with your own experiences.

## Language translation contributions

Fabrik's language strings are developed in UK English, but our users are worldwide.
If you would like to help contribute to translating from English to your own language, then
