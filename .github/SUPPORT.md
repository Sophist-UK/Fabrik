# Contributing to Fabrik

Congratulations on finding your way to our Github repository, the home of Fabrik's source code.

Most people come here to grab a copy of the very latest code base - and that is fine.
But this is also the place to log Github issues if you have identified a definite bug in Fabrik (see below),
or to contribute enhancements or bug fixes via Github's Pull Request process.

However, if you are looking for help on how to use Fabrik,
or if you are not sure whether the problem you are having is a bug or not,
then you should make a search on
[Fabrikar.com's community forum](http://fabrikar.com/forums/index.php?forums/community.99/),
and if you can't find an answer there feel free to post a new question.
**Note:** Github is **not** the place for you to ask for help on how to use Fabrik.
